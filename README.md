- “Not now” customers can get a future follow-up date.
- The built-in UK calendar now supports both past dates and future booking/reminder dates.
- Customer records can be edited.
- Customer deletion now requires confirmation and cleans up related follow-up state.
- The global “Contact previous customers” control now actually changes eligibility.
- Results now includes locally calculated customer-action activity.
- Old v0.6 marked-done actions are migrated back to pending so the richer workflows can be tested.

### Latest v0.6 sweep
